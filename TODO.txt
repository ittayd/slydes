slides are shown according to a path:
- either linearization of all elements with 'step' class
(- or specified by "pos=n" class (if = is a legal char. otherwise, :))
- or programmatically, by changing the initial variable

can use onEnter/onExit on steps and receive their position

slides are loaded by the master container. this should solve stuff like same origin policies. can host in github...

saving of notes: load original file, replace all "note" elements with current ones. 
- how to add notes to slides that don't have them? maybe a separate notes div? link by path position? 

passing options programatically (slydes.config({...})
